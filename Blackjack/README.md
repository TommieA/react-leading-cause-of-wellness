Poker!!

This is a very basic game of Poker.  A standard 52 card deck is used.

To start the game, Enter the names of Player 1 and Player 2.  
If you do not enter names, they are the default Player 1 and Player 2.

Hit the Deal button.

5 cards are delt to each player.  The deck is shuffled on the first Deal or anytime the cards in the deck fall below 16.

To discard cards, just click on the card you want to discard.  It will be removed from the hand.

When all the cards are discarded, click the Draw button.  The discarded cards will be replaced by new cards.

Decide which hand is better and click the Win button under that hand.  The counter for that hand will be increased and the cards will be re-delt.  Do everything again.  Technically, you can play forever.
